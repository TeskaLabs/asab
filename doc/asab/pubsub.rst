Publish-Subscribe
=================

.. py:currentmodule:: asab

Publishâ€“subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, send the messages to receivers, called subscribers, via PubSub message bus. Publishers don't directly interact with subscribers in any way. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more message types and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

.. py:class:: PubSub(app)

ASAB ``PubSub`` operates with a simple messages, defined by their *message type*, which is a string.
We recommend to add ``!`` (explamation mark) at the end of the message type in order to distinguish this object from other types such as Python class names or functions.
Example of the message type is e.g. :any:`Application.run!` or :any:`Application.tick/600!`.

The message can carry an optional positional and keyword arguments.
The delivery of a message is implemented as a the standard Python function.


*Note:* There is an default, application-wide Publish-Subscribe message bus at :any:`Application.PubSub` that can be used to send messages.
Alternatively, you can create your own instance of :py:class:`PubSub` and enjoy isolated PubSub delivery space.


Subscription
------------

.. py:method:: PubSub.subscribe(message_type, callback)

Subscribe to a message type. Messages will be delivered to a ``callback`` callable (function or method).
The ``callback`` can be a standard callable or an ``async`` coroutine.
Asynchronous ``callback`` means that the delivery of the message will happen in a ``Future``, asynchronously.

``Callback`` callable will be called with the first argument

Example of a subscription to an :any:`Application.tick!` messages.

.. code:: python

	class MyClass(object):
		def __init__(self, app):
			app.PubSub.subscribe("Application.tick!", self.on_tick)

		def on_tick(self, message_type):
			print(message_type)


Asynchronous version of the above:

.. code:: python

	class MyClass(object):
		def __init__(self, app):
			app.PubSub.subscribe("Application.tick!", self.on_tick)

		async def on_tick(self, message_type):
			await asyncio.sleep(5)
			print(message_type)


.. py:method:: PubSub.subscribe_all(obj)

To simplify the process of subscription to :any:`PubSub`, ASAB offers the decorator-based *"subscribe all"* functionality.


In the followin example, both ``on_tick()`` and ``on_exit()`` methods are subscribed to :any:`Application.PubSub` message bus.

.. code:: python

	class MyClass(object):
		def __init__(self, app):
			app.PubSub.subscribe_all(self)

		@asab.subscribe("Application.tick!")
		async def on_tick(self, message_type):
			print(message_type)

		@asab.subscribe("Application.exit!")
		def on_exit(self, message_type):
			print(message_type)


.. py:method:: PubSub.unsubscribe(message_type, callback)

Unsubscribe from a message delivery.


.. autoclass:: asab.Subscriber
	:members:
	:undoc-members:

The subscriber object can be also used as `an asynchonous generator`.
The example of the subscriber object usage in `async for` statement:

.. code:: python

	async def my_coroutine(self):
		# Subscribe for a two application events
		subscriber = asab.Subscriber(
			self.PubSub,
			"Application.tick!",
			"Application.exit!"
		)
		async for message_type, args, kwargs in subscriber:
			if message_type == "Application.exit!":
				break;
			print("Tick.")


Publishing
----------

.. py:method:: PubSub.publish(message_type, \*args, \**kwargs)

Publish a message to the PubSub message bus.
It will be delivered to each subscriber synchronously.
It means that the method returns after each subscribed ``callback`` is called.

The example of a message publish to the :any:`Application.PubSub` message bus:

.. code:: python

	def my_function(app):
		app.PubSub.publish("mymessage!")


Asynchronous publishing of a message is requested by ``asynchronously=True`` argument.
The ``publish()`` method returns immediatelly and the delivery of the message to subscribers happens, when control returns to the event loop.

The example of a **asynchronous version** of a message publish to the :any:`Application.PubSub` message bus:

.. code:: python

	def my_function(app):
		app.PubSub.publish("mymessage!", asynchronously=True)


Synchronous vs. asynchronous messaging
--------------------------------------

ASAB PubSub supports both modes of a message delivery: synchronous and asynchronous.
Moreover, PubSub also deals with modes, when asynchronous code (coroutine) does publish to synchronous code and vice versa.

+-----------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|                 | Sync publish           | Async publish                               |
+-----------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Sync subscribe  | Called immediately     | ``call_soon(...)``                          |
+-----------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Async subscribe | ``ensure_future(...)`` | ``call_soon(...)`` & ``ensure_future(...)`` | 
+-----------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+


Application-wide PubSub
------------------------

.. py:attribute:: Application.PubSub

The ASAB provides the application-wide Publish-Subscribe message bus.


Well-Known Messages 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of well-known messages, that are published on a ``Application.PubSub`` by ASAB itself.


.. option:: Application.init!

This message is published when application is in the init-time.
It is actually one of the last things done in init-time, so the application environment is almost ready for use.
It means that configuration is loaded, logging is setup, the event loop is constructed etc.


.. option:: Application.run!

This message is emitted when application enters the run-time.


.. option:: Application.stop!

This message is emitted when application wants to stop the run-time.
It can be sent multiple times because of a process of graceful run-time termination.
The first argument of the message is a counter that increases with every ``Application.stop!`` event.


.. option:: Application.exit!

This message is emitted when application enter the exit-time.


.. option:: Application.tick!
.. option:: Application.tick/10!
.. option:: Application.tick/60!
.. option:: Application.tick/300!
.. option:: Application.tick/600!
.. option:: Application.tick/1800!
.. option:: Application.tick/3600!
.. option:: Application.tick/43200!
.. option:: Application.tick/86400!

The application publish periodically "tick" messages.
The default tick frequency is 1 second but you can change it by configuration ``[general] tick_period``.
:any:`Application.tick!` is published every tick. :any:`Application.tick/10!` is published every 10th tick and so on.


.. option:: Application.hup!

This message is emitted when application receives UNIX signal ``SIGHUP`` or equivalent.

.. option:: Application.housekeeping!

This message is published when application is on the time for housekeeping. The time for housekeeping is set to 03:00 AM UTC by default.

The app listens every ten minutes to see if it's time for housekeeping. If the UTC time reaches the value for housekeeping, the app will publish it and set the time for the next housekeeping for the next day at the same time.
There is also a time limit, which is set to 05:00 AM UTC by default. If the computer is in a sleep state, housekeeping will not be performed. Then, when the computer is reawakened again, it will check if it has exceeded the time limit. If not, then housekeeping will be published. If it has exceeded it, it simply informs the user and sets the housekeeping time for the next day.

Both housekeeping time and time limit can be changed in the configuration file:

.. code:: ini

	[housekeeping]
	at=19:30
	limit=21:00

This sets the housekeeping time to 7:30 PM UTC and the time limit to 9:00 PM UTC.
The time must be written in the format 'HH:MM'.
Remind yourself that the time is set to UTC, so you should be careful when operating in a different timezone.
