# Transport Layer Security

**Transport Layer Security** protocol (*TLS*, also known as *"Secure Sockets Layer"*) is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over a computer network, so that the web servers can use **HTTPS**.

For adding the HTTPS to ASAB web applications, there is a `asab.tls.SSLContextBuilder` class that is connected to [`asab.web.WebContainer`](/reference/web/web-server/#asab.web.WebContainer).
